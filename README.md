## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using AirBnB data from last years till 2018 to better understand:

 * How are the Amsterdam neighborhoods influencing the price per night
 * How well can the number of reviews influence the price?
 * How is the room type influencing the price?
 * How well can we predict availability? What is influencing the availability?
 
## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are '??' notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https:).
